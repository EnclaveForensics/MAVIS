title: Fine Tuning
---
**Fine-tuning** in the context of a **Large Language Model (LLM)** is the process of taking a pre-trained model and continuing its training on a smaller, task-specific dataset to adapt it for a particular domain, task, or tone. This allows the model to specialize and perform better on specific use cases than it would with general training alone.

Fine-tuning an LLM for **code analysis** involves several challenges:

1. **Data Quality**: High-quality, labeled code datasets (e.g. with bug annotations or explanations) are scarce.
2. **Complex Semantics**: Code requires deep understanding of syntax, logic, and execution context, which is harder to capture than natural language.
3. **Token Limitations**: Long code files may exceed the modelâ€™s context window, limiting effectiveness.
4. **Overfitting**: Small, domain-specific datasets can lead to overfitting and reduced generalizability.
5. **Evaluation Difficulty**: Measuring success in code analysis (e.g. correctness, security issues) is non-trivial and often requires expert validation.
